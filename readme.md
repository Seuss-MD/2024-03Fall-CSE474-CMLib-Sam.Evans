# Overview

This is my first attempt at making a CM Library. I am very excited to see how well I do!

The configuration Management (CM) Library consists of a hierarchal folder structure. Each CI has a unique identifier, typically an alphanumeric string representing its purpose, version, and use. 

The CM Library consists of two sub-libraries: The Product Library and the Project Library.
